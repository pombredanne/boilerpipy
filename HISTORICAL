Hi Sharmila,

This email is about reaching out to you to get maintainer ship of your project
on readability, to a newly revamped code base on github.com written by me.

The project i am referring to is --> https://code.google.com/p/decruft/

I am writing down the AUTHOR file and README.md you as the Original Author,
but i request your consent that i will move forward to maintain this project
in the long run and changing the copyright to my own needs.

While i have sufficiently improved upon your project -> to support the new
readability.js codebase and also a complete restructuring of the project. Also
adding new techniques to improve upon accuracy in terms of readability
applied on various corpus of websites.

This repo will also have other changes from boilerpipe project -
https://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/ which is written in java.
I am planning to write the whole project into Python which will
succeed your work.

Let me know if this is acceptable for ownership change and also
Copyright change, feel free to visit
https://github.com/harshavardhana/boilerpipy and poke around.

Thank you :-)

-Harsha
